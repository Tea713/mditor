# Mditor

In the work text editor by me. I try to use few external dependecies as a learning experience. It is actually decently fast.

Named Mditor because it was intended to be a markdown editor. Kinda wanted to be a regular editor with markdown features afterwards (maybe a new name later???).

# How to use

Clone and run with `cargo run --release`

Not too sure how it would run on Linux/MacOS since I am only on windows.

# TODO:

- Implement undo/redo stack
- Settings
- UI changes (Thinking of a retro styles for fun but may include more theme if I have the time)
- Support for markdown display
- Integration with Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting
- Side bar, tabs for file nav and such
